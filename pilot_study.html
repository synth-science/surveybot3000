class="section level4">
<h4>Accuracy by whether scales were real or random</h4>
<p>The SurveyBot3000 does not “know” whether scales were published in
the literature or formed at random. Knowing what we do about the
research literature in psychology, we can infer that published scales
will usually exceed the Nunnally threshold of .70. Hence, we know that
the synthetic alphas for published scales should rarely be below .70. If
we regress synthetic alphas on empirical alphas separately for the
scales taken from the literature, we see this as a bias (a positive
regression intercept of .68 and a slope ≠ 1, .26). Still, the synthetic
alpha estimates are predictive of empirical alphas with an accuracy of
.65.</p>
<p>There is no clear bias for the random scales. When both are analyzed
jointly, the clear selection bias for the published scales is mostly
averaged out but is reflected in the slope exceeding 1.</p>

<h4>As in our Stage 1 submission</h4>
<p>Here are the results if we calculate the accuracy and prediction
error as in the Stage 1 submission. We now think this approach, by
conditioning on random variation in the empirical correlations, gave a
misleading picture of the accuracy and bias of the synthetic Cronbach’s
alphas. Here we report the results if we conduct the analysis as in
Stage 1 (but with the corrected SE of empirical alphas).</p>
