# SurveyBot3000 repository
This repository is structured as follows

- `training` contains the Python code used to fine-tune the model, the parameters and package versions.
- `pilot_study` contains the R code used to evaluate the accuracy of SurveyBot3000's synthetic estimates and generate the figures in the manuscript. Here, we also run our precision simulations to assess the precision the planned validation study can achieve. It also contains information on the used R package versions.
- `validation_study` contains the plans for our preregistered validation study. Here, you find the items we plan to collect, the survey as we designed it, as well as the synthetic estimates predicted by SurveyBot3000. The analysis code for the accuracy will mirror that of the pilot study.
