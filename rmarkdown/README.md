# SurveyBot3000 holdout analysis
This repository is structured as follows

- The rmarkdown files (ending in `.Rmd`) load the empirical data from the holdout
  and the synthetic data generated by SurveyBot3000 (`1_vector_to_cosine.Rmd`).
- Empirical correlations and synthetic cosine similarities are computed, and 
  Cronbach's alphas are computed from these (`1_vector_to_cosine.Rmd`).
- In the main analysis, `index.Rmd` the accuracies of the synthetic estimates 
  are computed.
- In the `3_rr_precision_simulations.Rmd`, we simulate the precision our planned
  validation study can hope to achieve.
